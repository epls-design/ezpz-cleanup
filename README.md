Wordpress MU-Plugin and files to white-label, clean up the wp_head, and create a client admin role

## To use:

1. Copy the two folders (mu-plugins and uploads) into wp-content
2. Install "User Role Editor" plugin from the Wordpress Plugins store, to further edit user roles and prevent the Client Admin role from editing/deleting the master admin role.
